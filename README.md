# currency-converter-project
 making a currency converter that allows you to convert multiple currencies
 so far the code is very inefficient but im glad I get a better feel of how 
 useState works and how programming with react instead vanilla js , its
 kinda uncomfortable knowing to do stuff in vanilla js but still feeling kinda impaired with doing it in react but soon enough I'll manage to fully port my vanilla js thinking process to react thinking process. Trust.
